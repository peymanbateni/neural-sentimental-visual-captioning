# Sentimentalized Visual Captioning using Attentional Autoencoders

Initially titled neural image sentiment comparison, the work here aims to previous work on visual sentiment analysis and captioning by proposing novella approaches to sentiment classification and caption combining using updates and noun-forcing. For further, details please read our paper [here](Sentimentalized_Image_Captioning_using_Encoder-Decoder_Networks_with_Attention.pdf). No model checkpoints are included as part of the repository due to file size limits.
